# Deep Learning For Psychiatric Disorder Diagnosis

This repository hosts the code and resources for a research project, delving into the application of deep learning techniques, particularly focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), for the classification of psychiatric disorders using MRI brain images.

## Objectives

- Lead a research project focusing on the application of deep learning methods for psychiatric disorder diagnosis.
- Utilize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data augmentation to enhance dataset diversity.
- Develop and refine Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to maximize classification accuracy.

## Methodology

- Processed raw NiFTI files using the FSL Software Package to create segmented brain images.
- Utilized generative models for data augmentation, generating new images to enhance dataset diversity.
- Developed and refined CNN models to maximize classification accuracy through training and fine-tuning.

## Results

The resulting findings of this research project were disseminated through a conference article published in [IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10335528).
